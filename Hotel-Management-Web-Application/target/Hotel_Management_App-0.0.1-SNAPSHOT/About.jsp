            <p> From very humble beginnings, Atithyam Resort was established in March 2021 with the opening of the landmark Atithyam Resort in Barrie-Ontario, Ranchi.

                Atithyam Resort with its signature architecture, in no time established itself as the market leader in the city. The Resort is synonymous with style, class and services which are of a truly international standard.

                In January 2022, another first class business hotel was opened to give the corporate traveler more choice and affordable quality, top of the line accommodation.

                Atithyam Resort is truly a Resort which showcases the best of contemporary interiors, unmatched services and cater to all of your business needs.

                The group has got ambitious growth plans and would always strive to be market leaders in the region they operate.
